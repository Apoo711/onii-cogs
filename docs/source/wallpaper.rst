A wallpaper cog which sends anime wallpapers:
=======================================


``[p]`` is considered as your prefix.

| This cog was made because I wanted a cog which would send anime wallpapers.
|
| Use ``[p]wallpaper`` to see what commands this cog has.

Setup And Installation
-------
 
1. | Start by adding the repo through ``[p]repo add onii-cogs`` and type ``I agree``
2. | Now add the cog through ``[p]cog install onii-cogs wallpaper``
3. | load the cog with ``[p]load wallpaper``
4. | Done! For a list of commands just type ``[p]wallpaper or [p]w`` and enjoy some anime wallpapers!
